A simple Esp32 project that acts as a wifi Portal for connected users to exchange messages via html.
To access chat when conected to esp32 wifi just input http://anything and it will bring up the web chat. (do not use https://)
Wifi chat currently has no password to conect to the wifi but you can add one if you wish this to be private.
