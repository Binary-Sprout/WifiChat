A simple Esp32 project that acts as a wifi portal for connected users to exchange messages via html webpage.
To access web chat when conected to esp32 wifi just input http://anything to your browser after connecting to the esp32 wifi and it will bring up the web chat. (do not use https://)
you can type /devices to access admin tools.
Wifi chat currently has no password to connect the wifi but you can add one if you wish this to be private.
